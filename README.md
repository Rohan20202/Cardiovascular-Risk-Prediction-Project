# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction-Project



# Problem Statement 

The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).



# Objective 

The main objective is to build a model that can predict the patient's risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in the next 10 years.


# Approach 

As the problem statement says the main objective is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). I have used the Decision Tree Classifier,Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K Near Neighbor, Naive Bayes Classifier, SVM Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier to train the model.


# Tools Used 
The whole project was done using python, in google collaborator. Following libraries were used for analyzing the data and visualizing: 

● Pandas: Extensively used to load and wrangle with the dataset. 

● Matplotlib: Used for visualization. 

● Seaborn: Used for visualization. 

● Warnings: For filtering and ignoring warnings. 

● Numpy: For some math operations in predictions. 

● Sklearn: For analysis and prediction.

● Stats models: For outliers influence.
